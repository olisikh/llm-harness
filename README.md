## Install model

Run from `~/.llm-harness`:

```bash
./harness.py install
```

Installer behavior:

- discovers harnesses from `harness/`, `harness-paths.yaml`, and `config.yaml`
- maps harness homes by convention:
  - `agents` -> `~/.agents`
  - `claude` -> `~/.claude`
  - `codex` -> `~/.codex`
- reads `harness-paths.yaml` for non-obvious roots like OpenCode and custom Hermes skill installs
- reads `config.yaml` to symlink all configured skill sources (submodules and `local-skills/<harness>/`) directly under target `skills/`, preserving nested category paths
- symlinks non-skill top-level files and directories from `harness/<name>/` 1:1 into target harness home
- removes stale managed symlinks
- warns and skips when target path already exists and is not matching expected symlink

To remove managed symlinks later:

```bash
./harness.py uninstall
```

## Operations

For step-by-step recipes on adding skills, registering shared sources, moving skills between harnesses, and troubleshooting, see [docs/llm-harness-ops.md](docs/llm-harness-ops.md).

There is also a local skill, `llm-harness-ops`, that provides a guided workflow for managing this repository.

## Skill source sync

Shared skill sources live as git submodules:

- `obsidian-skills`
- `mattpocock-skills`
- `llm-wiki`

Update submodule pointers with:

```bash
./harness.py update-skills
```

Optional commit/push flow:

```bash
./harness.py update-skills --commit --push
```

Sync rules:

- `config.yaml` defines all skill sources under `sources:` with `type: submodule` or `type: local`
- `harness.py update-skills` updates pinned submodule commits only for sources with `type: submodule`; it never creates symlinks inside the repo
- install-time mapping of skills to target harness homes is controlled by `config.yaml`
- later sources in `config.yaml` win on target-path collision

## Notes

- canonical checkout path is `~/.llm-harness`
- all skill sources are configured in `config.yaml` and symlinked directly to target harness homes
- shared skill submodules install from `~/.llm-harness/<submodule>`
- local first-party skill sources live under `~/.llm-harness/local-skills/<harness>/`
- harness-specific non-skill files live under `~/.llm-harness/harness/<name>/`
- Hermes package-bundled skills stay in the Hermes install/source tree, not in `llm-harness`
- OpenCode will discover both `~/.agents/skills` and `~/.config/opencode/skills`
- Claude portable-skill auto-discovery is deferred for now
